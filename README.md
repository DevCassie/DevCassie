### Pleasure to meet you ðŸ‘‹!

## Introduction
I'm a 19 year old media design student with a passion for both design and development. I mainly do JavaScript, but I'm always trying to learn more. 

I'm currently working on a big project which is not open source, but a side project which is going to be used within that big project is open source. That sideproject is called [Castoe Streamer](https://github.com/DevCassie/Castoe-Streamer).

Alongside that I've also created my own Visual Studio Code color theme. Which is at it's first release. The theme is called Darkio and can be found [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CasMartens.darkio).

## Personal
On the more personal side. My pronounces are he and him, don't let that nickname fool you ðŸ˜‰. I'm also very interesed in music both listening and playing. Yes I do play an instrument ðŸ˜„. I play an Ibanez AEG8EMH-OPN guitar. Which is half acoustic and half electric.
